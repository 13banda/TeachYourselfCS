A read through of MIT’s classic text The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, with worked examples.   Each video is one section of the book only- I want to present everything in bite-sized bits.  

You can go to MIT’s SICP site for more information, and to get the book yourself. https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/

The whole reason I am reading SICP at all is to follow the curriculum for learning computer science found at  https://teachyourselfcs.com/
